Entity Resolution Autoloader Pipeline - Architecture Diagram
This project implements a smart data pipeline that automatically loads entity data files from S3 into Delta Lake tables. The pipeline is designed to handle real-world data challenges like duplicate records and data quality issues while maintaining complete audit trails.

Architecture Diagram:
â€¢	- Files are loaded from the S3 bucket.
â€¢	- The autoloader pipeline discovers tables and lists files.
â€¢	- Each file is processed: data is read and transformed (handling VOID columns and type issues).
â€¢	- If unique keys are found, a MERGE is performed; otherwise, the table is OVERWRITTEN.
â€¢	- Change Data Feed (CDF) is enabled.
â€¢	- Processed files are archived.
â€¢	- A report and audit trail are generated.
â€¢	- Data lands in Delta Lake tables (bronze).
